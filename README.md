## About

This package is a work in progress, and includes different kinds of modules and
subsystems to work with CrateDB and CrateDB Cloud efficiently.


## Caveat

Please note that the `cratedb-toolkit` package contains alpha- and beta-quality
software, and as such, is considered to be a work in progress. Contributions of
all kinds are very welcome, in order to make it more solid, and to add features.

Breaking changes should be expected until a 1.0 release, so version pinning is
strongly recommended, especially when you use it as a library.

```shell
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/crate-workbench/cratedb-retention

Verify installation.
```shell
